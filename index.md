# An Introduction & About Me

Hello!  My name is Toby Cayce, and I'm here to become a professional game developer.  While playing around with level designers in my childhood was always fun, but comparing it to doing the real thing is far more enjoyable and satisfying.  With coding experience and several projects under my belt, I'm more than prepared to continue my work.
