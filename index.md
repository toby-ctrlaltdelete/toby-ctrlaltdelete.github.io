# An Introduction & About Me

Hello!  My name is <i><b>Toby Cayce</i></b>, and I'm a game developer.  While playing with old level design software was always fun, creating my own games and projects from scratch is much more enjoyable.

Below are a few projects that I've developed.

## My Projects

### Keymash Panic
A game where every single key is connected to its' own seperate, simple minigame, leading to twenty-four things to manage all at once (Q/W and O/P are conjoined).  The game itself is made in Unity, as it's the closest game engine I worked with back when I was in DigiPen.

Note that this build of the game is from early June, and is not representative of the final product.

### Cat Cafe
A small, simple game that me and all three other coders made as part of our final project in our Digipen course together with the art team - alongside working on the actual code for the project, I also fixed a lot of bugs in the code for the others.  It's not particularly long or complex, but it is the first game I have ever made.
