# An Introduction & About Me

Hello!  My name is Toby Cayce, and I'm here to become a professional game developer.  While playing around with level designers in my childhood was always fun, but comparing it to doing the real thing is far more enjoyable and satisfying.  With coding experience and several projects under my belt, I'm more than prepared to continue my work.

Below are a few projects that I've developed under my belt, both worked on by myself and with a group;

## My Projects

### Keymash Panic
A game where every single key is connected to its' own seperate, simple minigame, leading to twenty-four things to manage all at once (Q/W and O/P are conjoined).

### Cat Cafe
A small, simple game that me and all three other coders made as part of our final project in our Digipen course together with the art team - alongside working on the actual code for the project, I also fixed a lot of bugs in the code for the others.
