# About This Game

Cat Cafe is a simple project created for my Digipen class final with the other three programmers.  A lot of the time I spent was with bug fixing, which would probably qualify me more as a QA tester, but it's still a work I'm proud of.  It's admittedly not a very large game - you could complete it in a matter of minutes even with playing the tutorial - but it's still something.
