# About This Game

Cat Cafe is a simple project created for my Digipen class final with the other three programmers.  A lot of the time I spent was with bug fixing, which would probably qualify me more as a QA tester, but it's still a work I'm proud of.  It's admittedly not a very large game - you could complete it in a matter of minutes even with playing the tutorial - but it's still something.

The game was created initially with the idea of being a cafe game akin to those found in flash games, though given the simplicity of Digipen's not-quite-Unity system, a few concessions had to be made.  There's no character to control, so the most you do is take orders and click food quick enough to make it to the next level... of which there are only two.

While it wasn't a very big game, it was still the first thing I made, and for that it holds a special place in my heart.  All the work put into it was definitely a blast considering I was working with friends, and I hope to be able to do something similar to that in the future.
